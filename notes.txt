erm yes, the stuff I learnt from online tutorial and small projects, I made this txt file for myself, don't judge me:

x % y returns the remainder
x & y compares each binary bit => both 1 = 1, else = 0
x | y compares each binary bit => 1 "1" = 1, else = 0
x ^ y compares each binary bit => difference? = 1, else = 0
x << y || x >> y shifts the bits to the left/ right by y positions

buffer clearing:
int c; while ((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF) {}

~~currently trying to understand pointers stuff~~ (I can't)\
learning
